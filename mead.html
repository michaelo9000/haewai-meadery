				<h1>What is Mead?</h1>
				<p>Mead is a fermented alcoholic drink similar to beer, wine and cider. The distinguishing characteristic of mead is the use of honey in place of fruit juice or grains. Mixing 1 part honey with 2 or 3 parts water (depending on the desired sweetness) will yield mead after fermentation. The honey supplies sugar to the yeast to create alcohol, and once the mead is matured the yeasty flavour (typical of beer) is diminished, allowing the taste of the honey to define the flavour.</p>

					<p><span class="bold">Our mead</span> is crafted using fresh spring water which bubbles out right here in the meadery garden. We have the chemistry and the microbiology of this water laboratory tested before setting up a new vintage. Then we add just the right amount of honey which is dissolved in the spring water in our mixing tank. When the 'must' (the honey and water mixture) has the correct sugar gravity, we introduce the yeast and then the whole mixture is pumped into a fermentation tank where it will remain for around 3 - 5 months. It is then 'racked' to a secondary tank in order to separate it from any sediment which has formed. This racking process is performed 2 or 3 times over several months, and after 18 - 24 months the mead is mature and ready to be bottled and enjoyed.</p>

				<p>Traditionally, mead was considered a kind of healing elixir. It was once known as an aphrodisiac and tonic, said to benefit fertility and health particularly for a bride and groom on their honeymoon. This is the cause for our employment of the seahorse logo, a creature also associated with fertility.<br/>
				When herbs and spices are added to mead during aging, the resulting infused beverage is referred to as Metheglin. This name derives from a Welsh term meaning 'healing' <span class="italic">(meddyg)</span> 'liquor' <span class="italic">(llyn)</span>. We often infuse our meads with elderflower and peppermint, for both the taste and the healing properties these herbs possess. The herbs will steep in the mead for only 3 months during the lengthy aging process our meads undergo.</p>
